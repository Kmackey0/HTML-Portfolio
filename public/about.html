  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I’m <strong>Krischan Mackey</strong>, an aspiring web developer with a focus on creating simple, clean, and responsive websites. I’m currently learning and building hands-on projects to sharpen my skills — and I’m excited to grow in the field of web development.</p>

  <p>My portfolio includes beginner-friendly projects like a movie ranking site and a birthday invitation page, which demonstrate my understanding of HTML, CSS, and basic page structure. Each project helps me practice writing better code and designing more effective user experiences.</p>

  <p>I may be new to the industry, but I’m motivated, detail-oriented, and committed to learning and improving with every project.</p>

  <p>I’d love to collaborate or connect! <a href="./contact.html">get in touch</a></p>
